+# (ii)	as it can be seen, SSE2 performance is too low on legacy

+#	impressively better than IALU ones, which is why you won't
+#	find SSE2 code below;
+# (iii)	this is not optimal result for Atom because of MSROM
+#	limitations, SSE2 can do better, but gain is considered too
+#	low to justify the [maintenance] effort;

+	@
+	@ Trivia.
+	@
+	@ Result of multiplication of n-bit number by m-bit number is
+	@ n+m bits wide. However! Even though 2^n is a n+1-bit number,
+	@ m-bit number multiplied by 2^n is still n+m bits wide.
+	@
+	@ Sum of two n-bit numbers is n+1 bits wide, sum of three - n+2,
+	@ and so is sum of four. Sum of 2^m n-m-bit numbers and n-bit
+	@ one is n+1 bits wide.
+	@
+	@ >>+ denotes Hnext += Hn>>26, Hn &= 0x3ffffff. This means that
+	@ H0, H2, H3 are guaranteed to be 26 bits wide, while H1 and H4
+	@ can be 27. However! In cases when their width exceeds 26 bits
+	@ they are limited by 2^26+2^6. This in turn means that *sum*
+	@ of the products with these values can still be viewed as sum
+	@ of 52-bit numbers as long as the amount of addends is not a
+	@ power of 2. For example,
+	@
+	@ H4 = H4*R0 + H3*R1 + H2*R2 + H1*R3 + H0 * R4,
+	@
+	@ which can't be larger than 5 * (2^26 + 2^6) * (2^26 + 2^6), or
+	@ 5 * (2^52 + 2*2^32 + 2^12), which in turn is smaller than
+	@ 8 * (2^52) or 2^55. However, the value is then multiplied by
+	@ by 5, so we should be looking at 5 * 5 * (2^52 + 2^33 + 2^12),
+	@ which is less than 32 * (2^52) or 2^57. And when processing
+	@ data we are looking at triple as many addends...
+	@
+	@ In key setup procedure pre-reduced H0 is limited by 5*4+1 and
+	@ 5*H4 - by 5*5 52-bit addends, or 57 bits. But when hashing the
+	@ input H0 is limited by (5*4+1)*3 addends, or 58 bits, while
+	@ 5*H4 by 5*5*3, or 59[!] bits. How is this relevant? vmlal.u32
+	@ instruction accepts 2x32-bit input and writes 2x64-bit result.
+	@ This means that result of reduction have to be compressed upon
+	@ loop wrap-around. This can be done in the process of reduction
+	@ to minimize amount of instructions [as well as amount of
+	@ 128-bit instructions, which benefits low-end processors], but
+	@ one has to watch for H2 (which is narrower than H0) and 5*H4
+	@ not being wider than 58 bits, so that result of right shift
+	@ by 26 bits fits in 32 bits. This is also useful on x86,
+	@ because it allows to use paddd in place for paddq, which
+	@ benefits Atom, where paddq is ridiculously slow.
